Questions:

(Q1) What is the significance of the peripheral base address? Where does it point?

       DMA_InitStructure.DMA_PeripheralBaseAddr = (uint32_t)(&(SPIx->DR));

(Q2) Why is it necessary to enable incrementing as was done in this step? What will
     the DMA controller do in response to this configuration?

       DMA_InitStructure.DMA_MemoryBaseAddr = (uint32_t)tbuf;
       DMA_InitStructure.DMA_MemoryInc = DMA_MemoryInc_Enable;

(Q3) Why is this line of the code necessary?

       while (DMA_GetFlagStatus(dmaflag) == RESET) { ; }

(Q4) For transfers of less than 4 bytes, what do you think is the reason for not using
     the xchng_datablock functions?

(Q5) Why is it important for the DMA controller and the audio player to work on
     different portions of Audiobuf?
